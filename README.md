# Simulation and Layout for Arithmetic Logic Unit - 8-BIT
## Introduction
This project is to design an arithmetic-logic unit 8-BIT ALU which is part of the central processing unit responsible for all the actual calculations and logic operations. The ALU does all the addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. ALU is the mathematical brain of the CPU. The first part of this experiment will show the schematic design of the ALU using Or-CAD software that will help to design, test, and simulate the ALU circuit. The second part of the report shows the layout design of the ALU using the K-layout design, which is an excellent tool for simulating the transistor level of the CMOS circuit of all parts of the ALU.
## Part-1: Schematic design and PSPICE simulation
The simulation design is done in OrCAD Capture CIS.
